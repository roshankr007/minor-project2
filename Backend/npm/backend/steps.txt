install ejs from npm 
setup ejs as a view engine for this project  -> app.set('view-engine', 'ejs');
write basic route handlers and sever code
for ejs -> create a folder exactly with the name of 'views' 
     and inside it create a  file index.ejs 
from index.js server file when you send any response at a route , now you can render an ejs file at that route with
res.render('filename') line of code. 
NOTE - filename should be a valid filename inside views else is will throw error at that particular route as -
"no lookup found at views".

dynamic routing 
so we sometimes see there are some routes where only a part of route is changing and rest is fixed
ex-
/admin/roshan
/admin/rohit
/admin/dad

so if this route is for admin priveleges of a companya and suppose 100 people have this privelage 
then will we create a 100 different routes for this , no! we will then use dynamic routing 

syntax for creating a dynamic route - 
app.get('/author/:name', (req, res, next)=>{
     res.send('author is '+req.params.name);
     next();
})
this will create a dynamic route where : represent params of url and whatever part of a route is changing 
simply add : before that in route handler and it will give you a dynamic route.
