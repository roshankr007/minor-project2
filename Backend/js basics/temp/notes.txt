1. Variables in js 
prefer not to use var because of issue in block scope and functional scope 
VAR has function scope   
variables declared without any declarations become global only in non-strict mode.So, 
if we have a variable inside a function , declared without any declaration, and you are not
using strict mode , then it will become global.
If you do not initialise any variable, it holds undefined.

"use strict"   // defines to treat all js code as newer js 
automatically everything these days run on strict mode .
without writing anything also, we can declare a variable.
const can't be changed

2. Data Types
   primitives - 
     number => 2^53
     bigint => 
     string =>""
     boolean => true/false
     null => this is a standalone value in js
     undefined => no value given yet.
     symbol => used for uniqueness
to check typeof any varible - console.log(typeof "what's the type");

3.Data-types conversion
     we can convert into types into another by wrapping them and passing into another dt's 
     calss name 
     eg - let num = "3";
          let new_num = Number(num);
          console.log(typeof new_num) ; -> this will print number as it is now a number
          but what if we do - 
          let num ="3acsa"
          let anotherNum = Number(num);
          console.log(typeof anotherNum) -> this will print Number!!
          but when we do - 
               console.log(anotherNum) ; -> output of this will be Nan.!!
Note :- when typecasting / getting value from a response, always validate the type of it by printing it.

          2. let num = null;
               console.log(typeof Number(num)); -> 0;
              let num2 = undefined;
              console.log(typeof Number(num2)); -> undefined.

* core logic - so the thing is that Nan is still of type Number in js , and we do not get errors
becasue js is very loosely typed, and very permissive.
we can pass a variable in a function to check if it is nan or not = if(isNaN(anotherNum)){...}

// value true when converted to number will be 1.

now , converting int => boolean
1. true is converted to 1 and false into 0 or vice versa 
2. any integer value that is not 0 will be converted to true and only 0 is converted to false.

converting string => boolean
here, the conversion depends on the length of the string.
1. "" -> false 
2. any other string with len>0 -> true.

null => boolean -> gives false.
undefined => boolean -> gives false.
NaN => boolean -> gives false.

number, undefined , NaN, null, => string

object => string 
     eg - let obj = {a:2,}
          let c = String(obj);
          console.log(c); -> [object object]
          console.log(typeof c);string 

          //-> it call's the object's .toString() method, For plain objects (like yours), this method is inherited from Object.prototype.toString, which returns:
               "[object Object]". This can be done with .stringify() function.
